# CODSOFT_AUGUST-SMS-SPAM-DETECTION
The task is as....
SMS spam detection involves identifying whether a given text message is spam or not. This is typically done using machine learning techniques. Here's a simplified process:

Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing examples of both spam and non-spam (ham) messages. This dataset is used to train and evaluate the model.

Text Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data. This includes removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, tokenizing, and removing stopwords.

Feature Extraction: Convert the preprocessed text into numerical features that machine learning algorithms can understand. Common methods include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings.

Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for the task, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or a neural network.

Model Training: Train the selected model using the preprocessed and transformed text data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate validation or test dataset.

Deployment: Once the model performs well, deploy it to a system that can classify incoming messages as spam or ham.
